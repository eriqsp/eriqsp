## Hello! 👋

I'm Erick and I like to build things that are interesting to me, and could be to others as well.

My main tech stack contains Python, SQL and HTML. I also have some experience using Docker, n8n and AzureDevOps.

I've built some projects here, my favorite one being the [Counter-Strike Player Clustering](https://github.com/eriqsp/counter-strike-analysis).

At the moment I am working on the project [Anime Recommender System](https://github.com/eriqsp/anime-recommender). It gives *anime recommendations* using the content-based filtering approach and TensorFlow to build the embeddings.
