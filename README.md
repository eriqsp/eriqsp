## Welcome :)

I'm Erick and I like to build things that are interesting to me, and could be to others as well.

I have some projects here that are data science related - collecting, cleaning, transforming and training data. My favorite one is the [Counter-Strike Player Clustering](https://github.com/eriqsp/counter-strike-analysis).

You also can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-sp/).
